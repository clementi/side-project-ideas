# Side Project Ideas for Software Engineers

## CS Fundamentals

1. **FTP Client** (suggested implementation: web, desktop or CLI app). Build a simple FTP client. As a bonus challenge, support secure file transfer.

2. **HTTP Server** (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). To understand HTTP deeply, build an HTTP server. There are a number of [tutorials](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/) available to guide you through the process.

3. **Build a simple operating system** (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). This is a project that is technically challenging and will deepen your understanding of how computers and operating systems work. You might wish to start with the free (and cleverly named) book, [Operating Systems: From 0 to 1](https://tuhdo.github.io/os01/).

4. **Build a web scraper** (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). Build a tool that takes a URL as input and returns the content of the URL as HTML or XML.

5. **Bandwidth monitor** (suggested implementation: live updating CLI tool). Build a tool to track how much data you have downloaded or uploaded on the internet. Have it email you a weekly report of your usage. As a bonus challenge, predict peak usage times.

6. **Implement a cipher** (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). Build a tool that takes a string of text as input and encrypts it using a cipher, such as the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

7. **Create a downtime SMS alerter** (suggested implementation: app hooked up to the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest) for sending text messages). Create an app that takes a URL as input and sends you a text message when a request to the URL returns a response code other than 200 (OK).

## Personal Finance

8. **Net worth calculator and tracker** (suggested implementation: CLI, web, or mobile app). Build a calculator you can use to track the rise or fall of your net worth on a monthly basis. You can use something like this [net worth worksheet](http://www.schwabmoneywise.com/public/file/P-4038856/Net-Worth-Worksheet.pdf) from Charles Schwab to guide you. Optional extension: have it send you a 12 month report for the previous year on the first of January each year.

9. **Tax forecaster** (suggested implementation: web app). This will be particularly useful if you do any freelance software engineering. Build a tool that takes your freelance earnings as input and then predicts your expected tax liability for the rest of the financial year. Make it smart enough to predict periods of higher or lower demand for your services, and adjust accordingly.

10. **Deal finder** (suggested implementation: web app with mobile notifications). Build a simple web app to notify you when an item you covet goes on sale for a good price. You could use a web scraper to pull the item’s product page and notify you of any price changes.

11. **Expense tracker** (suggested implementation: web or mobile app). Create a simple interface you can use to add and categorize your expenses. Generate monthly reports based on the inputs and write custom alerts for things, like, “spending too much money on coffee… as always.”

12. **Financial independence calculator** (suggested implementation: web app). [Financial independence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) is, essentially, saving and investing as much of your income as possible so that you don’t need to work for money. While many financially independent people continue to work, they can now focus on doing work that they love, rather than work that pays the most. Build a tool to calculate, based on your: current savings, investments, income, retirement accounts, and expenses, how far away you are from financial independence. Some examples: [FIREcalc](https://www.firecalc.com/), [cFIREsim](http://www.cfiresim.com/).

13. **A bill splitter** (suggested implementation: mobile app). Build a simple tool to help you and your friends split bills when you go out to eat together.

# Side Project Ideas for Software Engineers

## CS Fundamentals

1. **FTP Client** (suggested implementation: web, desktop or CLI app). Build a simple FTP client. As a bonus challenge, support secure file transfer.

2. **HTTP Server** (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). To understand HTTP deeply, build an HTTP server. There are a number of [tutorials](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/) available to guide you through the process.

3. **Build a simple operating system** (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). This is a project that is technically challenging and will deepen your understanding of how computers and operating systems work. You might wish to start with the free (and cleverly named) book, [Operating Systems: From 0 to 1](https://tuhdo.github.io/os01/).

4. **Build a web scraper** (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). Build a tool that takes a URL as input and returns the content of the URL as HTML or XML.

5. **Bandwidth monitor** (suggested implementation: live updating CLI tool). Build a tool to track how much data you have downloaded or uploaded on the internet. Have it email you a weekly report of your usage. As a bonus challenge, predict peak usage times.

6. **Implement a cipher** (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). Build a tool that takes a string of text as input and encrypts it using a cipher, such as the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

7. **Create a downtime SMS alerter** (suggested implementation: app hooked up to the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest) for sending text messages). Create an app that takes a URL as input and sends you a text message when a request to the URL returns a response code other than 200 (OK).

## Personal Finance

8. **Net worth calculator and tracker** (suggested implementation: CLI, web, or mobile app). Build a calculator you can use to track the rise or fall of your net worth on a monthly basis. You can use something like this [net worth worksheet](http://www.schwabmoneywise.com/public/file/P-4038856/Net-Worth-Worksheet.pdf) from Charles Schwab to guide you. Optional extension: have it send you a 12 month report for the previous year on the first of January each year.

9. **Tax forecaster** (suggested implementation: web app). This will be particularly useful if you do any freelance software engineering. Build a tool that takes your freelance earnings as input and then predicts your expected tax liability for the rest of the financial year. Make it smart enough to predict periods of higher or lower demand for your services, and adjust accordingly.

10. **Deal finder** (suggested implementation: web app with mobile notifications). Build a simple web app to notify you when an item you covet goes on sale for a good price. You could use a web scraper to pull the item’s product page and notify you of any price changes.

11. **Expense tracker** (suggested implementation: web or mobile app). Create a simple interface you can use to add and categorize your expenses. Generate monthly reports based on the inputs and write custom alerts for things, like, “spending too much money on coffee… as always.”

12. **Financial independence calculator** (suggested implementation: web app). [Financial independence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) is, essentially, saving and investing as much of your income as possible so that you don’t need to work for money. While many financially independent people continue to work, they can now focus on doing work that they love, rather than work that pays the most. Build a tool to calculate, based on your: current savings, investments, income, retirement accounts, and expenses, how far away you are from financial independence. Some examples: [FIREcalc](https://www.firecalc.com/), [cFIREsim](http://www.cfiresim.com/).

13. **A bill splitter** (suggested implementation: mobile app). Build a simple tool to help you and your friends split bills when you go out to eat together.

## Games and Simulation

14. **Random name generator** (suggested implementation: CLI, web, or mobile app). Build a random name generator ([example](https://www.behindthename.com/random/)) that creates unique names on the fly, based on an algorithm. Use machine learning techniques to help you by training the program with a sample data set of names similar to those you want to generate. Otherwise, create your own lexical rules for how names are generated. For example, a name generating algorithm inspired by _The Handmaid's Tale_ might stipulate that names for Handmaid women should start with 'Of', and end with a random male name, e.g., Ofpeter.

15. **[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)** (suggested implementation: any platform capable of real-time graphical rendering). Conway’s Game of Life simulates the lives of simple cells that obey algorithmic laws. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE) explains how the game works and includes an example of one possible result.

16. **A procedurally generated map maker** (suggested implementation: browser-based app). Create a browser-based application that allows users to procedurally generate a terrain map based on a random seed. The map can be as detailed or as simple as you’d like. This project is a good opportunity to learn about [procedural generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation).

17. **A character generator** (suggested implementation: browser-based or mobile app, CLI). Create a tool that allows you to randomly generate playable characters for your favorite role-playing games, whether they be tabletop games, like Pathfinder, or video games, like _Divinity: Original Sin_.

18. **Interactive fiction** (suggested implementation: CLI). A fun way to get into game development without having to worry about graphical assets, interactive fiction renders the world for the player through text descriptions. [The Dreamhold](http://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/dreamhold/) is a good example of interactive fiction with a useful ‘help’ command.

## Artificial Intelligence

19. **An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe engine** (suggested implementation: CLI program). For an excellent first AI project, try to write an engine that cannot be beaten at Tic-Tac-Toe. You can achieve this by implementing this [strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy), which produces a draw as its worst-case outcome.

20. **A chess engine** (suggested implementation: an engine written in a programming language you want to learn, or master). Try to write an engine that can play chess against a human opponent using a [Universal Chess Interface](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html) compatible GUI, such as XBoard. See [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) as an example. For a less daunting challenge, you may wish to focus on the behavior of just one piece, e.g., Knights.

21. **A niche chatbot** (suggested implementation: web app). Some of the greatest minds in the world are working on chatbots that respond in lifelike ways. It’s an incredibly difficult challenge, but, by reducing the scope of your chatbot, you have a side project that is more approachable for evenings and weekends. Create a chatbot that produces real-sounding responses based on a niche topic that you’re passionate about: your favorite band, video game, sports team, or TV show. Leverage an existing library to help you, such as [ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot).

22. **A spam classifier** (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). Build a tool to classify whether an email is or isn’t spam based on the content alone. You can use this [public data set of emails from the Enron investigation](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset) to test your spam classifier.
